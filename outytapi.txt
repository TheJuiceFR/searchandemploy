2017-09-22T20:00:00Z	Map Making - Battle Bane: Episode 14	Minecraft Map Making. Today we start with a quick explanation of what Battle Bane is, with a few refinements to the game rules. Then we check out how the game has been modified to work with structure blocks and the new command blocks.\n\nLet's make a map! The goal of this series is to build a PvP arena of sorts, that is capable of a few specific technical functions needed for my game. The most important aspect of this game/map is the game design and rules, not really the map itself. More details will be revealed as we get further into things.	42jiWcWvrDk

Every run of the game can take several hours and can be very different from each other depending on what you get and the choices you make.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/233700/	JwVoIL-e8Ro

In Nail there are 2 teams, the Attackers and Defenders. \n\nThe goal of the Attackers is to breach through all of the castle's many defenses and destroy 2 sponge blocks hidden safely away at the far end of the map. The goal of the Defenders is to protect the sponge blocks with all their might for a whole 20 minutes. \n\nThe Defenders start the game 1 minute before the Attackers, which gives them a little window of opportunity to raid whatever chests they can from the Attackers, and get themselves settled safely within the castle walls.\n\n(Team: Invaders)\nlast_username: http://www.youtube.com/user/MCLastUsername\nthree_two: http://www.youtube.com/threetwoLP\nTiggyLi: http://www.youtube.com/user/TiggyLi\nasdjke: http://www.youtube.com/user/AsdjkeAndBro\n\n(Team: Defenders)\nraid3r: http://www.youtube.com/ixraider\nMonsieurApple: http://www.youtube.com/user/mrapplecomputer1\nnocxx: http://www.youtube.com/user/nocxxHD\nEtho: http://www.youtube.com/ethoslab\n\nMap Download: http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1191368-nail-a-pvp-4v4-defense-map/	WHTkAestDCQ

2012-08-07T10:51:04Z	Minecraft - Tutorial: Practical Mob System	This tutorial teaches you how to build my practical hostile mob system.\n\nPros: Compact, Easy, Quick, & Cheap to build. Doesn't cause block updates that would cause lag to your game. Works well in SMP.\nCons: Lower efficiency. Mobs are not forced off spawning pads so they may get stuck.\n\nMobs will not spawn within 24 blocks of your player.\nMobs will despawn if over 32 blocks from your player.\nMobs will go into sleep mode if over 32 blocks from your player.\nMobs will almost instantly despawn if over 128 blocks from your player.\nMobs can spawn in any loaded chunk in light levels 7 or less. Mobs are more likely to spawn in dark areas as they approach light level 0.	3S5x3qxl8s8

2011-12-16T19:22:17Z	Minecraft - Beautiful Beats (75k Special)	Thanks to everyone for your encouraging support! =)\r\nSorry, I have never been good with note blocks. ; )\r\n\r\nWorld Seed: -5414202391146285944\r\nWorld Download: http://www.mediafire.com/?fv81lti4fmeqfnn\r\n\r\nWhen I was planning this video I decided I wanted something amazing in the foreground, and something amazing in the background.\r\n\r\nThe TNT Beats is what I chose to do for the foreground. Originally I planned on having much much more TNT... including cannons. However, I began experiencing severe lag issues and other problems early on. Surrounding the TNT partially with obsidian helped to reduce lag from the block drops, but it became clear I had to stop using TNT for the second half of the video. You can see towards the end of the mine cart ride things were getting very choppy already and the map wasn't loading.\r\n\r\nThe Etho'fied Nether is what I did for the background... something to appease people if their eyes wandered from the TNT. I always felt that the Nether has amazing level generation which is under appreciated due to the dull lighting and block textures, and lack of block variety. A few simple steps in mcedit transformed the dull terrain into one of the most beautiful areas I have ever seen in Minecraft.\r\n\r\nSong: \"Temperence\", by Matt McFarland\r\nWebsite: http://www.mattmcfarland.com/\r\nThanks for providing people with excellent music that we can use.

2011-10-11T07:46:49Z	Legendary - Episode 1: Bring On The Pain	This is the beginning of my new Legendary series. Like Canopy Carnage, this is another one of Vechs' Super Hostile maps which aim to be very difficult and have the goal of completing a victory monument. Basically, you need to get wool by taking on very difficult dungeons.\r\n\r\nMuch death and frustration are to be expected.\r\n\r\nI'll be playing this on Hard difficulty throughout. I am not allowed to use F3.

2011-09-23T08:56:09Z	Let's Play Minecraft - Ep.104: EATS Upgrade	Note: This was recorded a few days ago. The new plan is to start another new world when 1.9 gets officially released.\n\nThis doesn't happen often, a patch that actually helps to improve the EATS concept. In the new world I plan on using EATS roads and minecart tracks a lot more. \n\nP.S. I know I failed with the directions thing. Big surprise right? I got turned around while looking at the sky. You get mossy stone by breaking stairs facing South and cracked stone from stairs facing East.	V-mSbxJZ92M
2011-09-23T00:59:16Z	Minecraft - Tutorial: Water Spawner	Today I'm just showing off another idea I plan to incorporate into my possible survival map. Pushing the mobs into the water with pistons forces them to swim.\r\n\r\nMonster spawners stop spawning mobs if there are 6 or more mobs of that type within a 17x17x9 area centered on the spawner. Placing the water spawner in water 3 or more blocks deep prevents this limiter because the mobs will always swim outside of that range on their own. This makes it possible for these water spawners to continue to spawn many many mobs if the player is within range of them.\r\n\r\nThe TNT self destruct feature is meant to keep things fun and fair.

2011-09-17T08:26:23Z	Let's Play Minecraft - Ep.102: Aloha	Thanks for all the feedback and support you all have been giving me. This feels like the right move.\n\nWhen I get more settled I plan on rebuilding some of the things we left behind, like the trivia game, and I would like to do a good RGB setup some time. Rebuilding stuff is easy, figuring out how to build things is what takes the time.\n\nI'm hoping I chose well for the episode name syntax. I didn't want the name to get super long by adding the \"Season 2\" stuff in it. Also, as many suggested, it is probably best to continue on from #102 instead of #1 so that new viewers do not get confused.\n\nEtho's Passive Mob 1.8 Summary:\n-they can spawn on other blocks besides grass, such as stone and wood\n-they do not seem to spawn in ocean or desert biomes\n-passive mob limit seems to be 17\n-the best way to get passive mobs to spawn is to move around and explore, they seem to spawn when new chunks are loaded\n-I've read passive mobs will attempt to spawn over time as well, which is attempted every 400 ticks (was every 1 tick before)... or every 20 seconds\n-they seem to spawn only on top of blocks exposed to sunlight\n-they do not seem to despawn over time like they used to\n-they will almost instantly despawn if you move far enough away from them, which I believe to still be a 128 block distance	doMN2z16DFc

2011-08-24T08:32:40Z	Let's Play Minecraft - Episode 94: Spider System	The goal for today is to get the spider spawning system setup. I figured it out the design on paper a bit before I got started.\n\nThis is actually my second attempt at this. I maybe should have did a third before releasing.\n\nroboticaust: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DKlQ28etIM\n\n*Spoiler*\n\nBesides the problem with the spiders not entering the water canals; I also failed to take into consideration that a spider only spawning system has less that 1/4 the normal spawning rate.\n\nEven if I could some how light up all the caves in the area, I still think I would need at least 2000 spawning spaces for a spider only system, with a 15 to 30 second kill rate, to reach its full potential. Spider only spawning systems do not seem to be practical to build for vanilla players.\n\nWorld Download (93): http://www.mediafire.com/?up1tnwzfi121pzu	nEK-rsxpLgo

This can be used to detect day and night cycles as a redstone signal.\n\nThe Light Sensor is built from 3 main components. A piston is used to control killing grass during the night, and growing grass during the day. A redstone BUD Switch is used to detect grass growing and dying. A T-FlipFlop memory unit keeps track of the day and night cycle.\n\nIf it rains during the day, the Light Sensor will still detect it as being day, despite the darker conditions.\n\nFallOfWar: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYB928Bur0g\n\nWorld Download (83): http://www.mediafire.com/?yx1k9t9nbmdm3cm	rVWndB7k4bQ

2011-08-04T08:34:24Z	DOTT - Episode 1: Naive Human	Maniac Mansion 2: Day Of The Tentacle is a point and click style adventure game released in 1993 by Lucas Arts. Like many people, it is one of my favorite games.\n\nThe story is crazy, the characters are hilarious, and the game is fairly challenging the first time you play it.\n\nThe game is short when you know what to do. I expect this series will be between 10 to 15 episodes total. I know what to do, but I'm trying to play this a bit slower than normal. I want to take the time to activate dialog and little events I normally would just skip through.	vyqsLVOHWzI

Finally we quickly consider how to build simple 4-way mobavators for a 1x1 shaft, which is useful if your are transporting mobs using 1 wide tubes or canals.\n\nThis 4-way mobavator is based on the original mobavator I saw in this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HezgBRwlRvI\n\nTo learn how I built the hostile mob system shown in this video, watch this hostile mob system tutorial: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8YJfAwYOz0\n\nFor a simple hostile mob killing mechanism and loot collection system, watch this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2Mv-nIky2A\n\nA special thanks is deserving to both Bohnmeal and Kasfexr for pointing out the simple fix for getting the mobavator working again after Beta 1.6+.

2011-05-30T07:51:30Z	Harvest Moon 64 - Day 001 - 1/1/03	This is the first episode of my experimental Harvest Moon 64 LP & WalkThrough.\r\n\r\nThis is a casual game that you can play at your own pace. Recently though I've learned the advanced mechanics of the game and the many requirements needed to finish the game with a perfect ending.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to finish the game with all 16 photos in the album and receive a perfect evaluation without intentionally using any game glitches, exploits, or \"strategies\" that I consider cheap. These include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n#1: No use of gameshark codes.\r\n#2: No taking advantage of affection exploits. (such as the Karen/dog exploit, multiple music boxes, animal abuse, etc.)\r\n#3: No cheap tool leveling. I may only level up a tool by using it for its purpose and outside.\r\n#4: No save state / replay abuse to get what I want, unless it's required or within reason.\r\n#5: Along with rule #4, no intentional weather manipulation unless required. (ex. needing a sunny Fall 7th)\r\n#6: I am only allowed to have 1 free drink a day. (no infinite stamina from wine, milk, water)\r\n#7: I am not allowed to use the horse and dogs race glitch to get free medals.\r\n#8: I am not allowed to use medical herbs if my player is totally fatigued to prevent sickness.\r\n\r\nFor an extra self-imposed challenge, I must:\r\n#1: Go to sleep before the day ends (6 am).\r\n#2: Wait until the 3rd year before I can get the awesome blue power berry, which has the ability to prevent fatigue / sickness.\r\n\r\nIn this run I plan to get:\r\n#1: 4001+ combined affection points from the villagers\r\n#2: all 5 girls fall in love with me\r\n#3: sick 0 days.\r\n#4: 4 cows, 4 sheep, 6 chickens\r\n#5: 9000+ shipped crops\r\n#6: 1000+ shipped eggs or milk\r\n#7: 201+ fish\r\n#8: all 6 house extentions\r\n#9: all 35 recipes\r\n#10: 100,000G+ ending cash\r\n#11: 220+ player happiness\r\n#12: all 10 power berries and the super special blue power berry in year 3\r\n#13: 384+ planted grass squares\r\n\r\nShoutouts to SomeCrazyGuy, kirbyarm, & Sam Van Dam for contributing most to the reverse engineering of Harvest Moon 64 to figure out exactly what is required to beat it.\r\nCheck out this guide if you want to learn the game's inner workings: http://www.gamefaqs.com/n64/197528-harvest-moon-64/faqs/41454	RAZU-iAwfAM

2011-03-08T08:25:32Z	Let's Play Minecraft - Episode 35: Collecting Farm Mobs	I show off the start of my new hostile mob system. The aim is to make it super efficient so that only about 12 spawning pads will be needed total. If I understand things correctly, this 12 spawning pad system will actually be more efficient than if I was to make it 17x17 spawning pads (289).\n\nI show a very cool x-ray vision trick that FreakEntertainer taught me via PM on YouTube. I will be using this one often.\n\nWe also start Levels 3 & 4. I spend most of this video setting up 4, 14x14 (16x16 pattern) grass spawning pads on Level 4 to spawn large amounts of the farm animal mobs. I vastly improve efficiency of the spawning pads by killing incredible amounts of grass surrounding the area.\n\nThis is a very strange and unique approach to automating farm mob harvesting. You are free to make your own systems based on my idea. Be warned though that it is a lot of work, and you may want to wait to see how successful mine ends up being so that you know if it is worth the effort.\n\nI will make a more detailed tutorial about how to setup a similar system in a few weeks if enough people seem interested in the idea.\n\nFreakEntertainer: http://www.youtube.com/user/FreakEntertainer\n\nWorld Download: http://www.fileserve.com/file/bvbfpNm	ZnyhwKY7A1Y

2011-03-04T09:24:42Z	Minecraft - Tutorial: Mob System (Part 4)	This part of the tutorial shows you how you can attach a mob drowning machine to your mobavator. The one I build in this video delivers 100% of the mob drops, works with zombies, skeletons, creepers, and spiders, has a collection system, and it can handle large quantities of mobs due to a mob compression system.\n\nThe mob killing machine I build here is only a suggestion. There are many different possible configurations you may wish to use instead.	exkCN-KXYEo
2011-02-28T09:01:01Z	Minecraft - Tutorial: Mob System (Part 3)	In this part of the tutorial we consider some various methods for improving the efficiency of our mob system. The main way we do this is by decreasing the probability that mobs will spawn in other areas outside of our spawning pads.\n\nLighting up the surface area with torches improves efficiency at night by preventing hostile mobs from spawning on the surface. Lighting up tunnels and cave systems is also very important for decreasing the amount of surface area hostile mobs can spawn on.\n\nMost important is that we light up any tunnels in the area of our spawning pads within 32 blocks from the surface. It is also very important that we light up all tunnels directly below our spawning pads.\n\nBy decreasing the unwanted surface area where hostile mobs may spawn, and increasing the surface area of our spawning grounds, we increase the probability of making the mobs spawn where we want them to.\n\nIf you are wondering about the numbers I talk about, these graphs explain it better than I ever could: http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1020&t=117374&p=1854918&hilit=mob+science#p1787514\n\n#1: No mobs will spawn within a 24 block radius sphere (48 diameter, 1810 surface area) all around your player.\n\n#2: No mobs will despawn within a 32 block radius sphere (64 diameter, 3217 surface area) all around your player.\n\n#3: Mobs within a 128 block radius sphere (256 diameter, 51472 surface area), but outside the 32 block radius sphere will randomly despawn after a certain time. This amount of time I estimate to be roughly 1 minute to 1.5 minutes on average. It may be shorter or longer. Different people have posted conflicting information about how this actually works.\n\n#4: Mobs spawn within a 144 block radius square (288x288 total, 82944 surface area) all around your player, except within the 24 block radius sphere. Any mobs outside of the 128 block radius sphere will almost immediately despawn.	bAV_UWceqto
2011-02-26T09:12:38Z	Minecraft - Tutorial: Mob System (Part 2)	This video continues my tutorial explaining in detail how to construct your own replica of my mob system.	FzZBWbLdi1U
2011-02-24T09:20:44Z	Let's Play Minecraft - Episode 33: Beta 1.3	The new patch has brought many new changes. Awesome lighting, compact repeaters, new half steps, beds, and a number of other game design improvements.\n\nUnfortunately the new patch has also screwed up the new automatic mob sorter.\n\nI spend sometime playing with the new repeaters and we even build a mini vertical cannon with a compact variable timer. I may also mention something about being greedy.\n\nCoestar's Channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/Coestar	ntU6j-et1io
2011-02-23T08:46:51Z	Minecraft - Tutorial: Mob System (Part 1)	This tutorial teaches you how to construct my mob spawning, collecting, transporting, controlling, and killing system.\n\nMain advantages of this system are that you:\n-can hide the spawning grounds completely underground\n-do not need to stand and wait in a specific spot to make it work\n-can transport the mobs to whatever location you choose\n-can use the live mobs for other purposes\n-can expand the system as you please to spawn more mobs\n\nThere are, however, better mob system designs if your only intention is to get as many mob drops possible.\n\nDig a 2x2 elevator from your world's surface down 26 blocks. The spawning pads are 14x14 (196 surface area), and follow a 16x16 pattern (14x14 / 16x16 = 76.5% space efficiency).	mZiMCUkxPO8

All in all though, I only get around to building the inner ring of dispensers.\r\n\r\nThe idea I had for labeling the storage areas doesn't look or work as well as I was expecting. I decide to halt work on it until I get some feedback from my viewers.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the episode I (try my best) to explain some of the issues with playing music with an EATS road. It's possible to do, but you will have to sacrifice either tempo, rhythm, or flexibility in your songs.	83MXderiLwo

2011-01-27T08:50:00Z	Let's Play Minecraft - Episode 20: Mob Decompression Chamber	Todays episode begins with me demonstrating, what I believe to be, a new form of transportation in Minecraft that I am going to refer to as \"Warp Speed\".\r\n\r\nBasically how Warp Speed works is, it utilizes the velocity added to the player if he bumps into a mob. In this example I bump into about 50 mobs all at once. This causes me to travel a horizontal distance of about 50 meters while falling vertically about 10 meters in about 0.7 seconds.\r\n\r\nThis episode focuses on the building of a decompression chamber so that we can separate the mobs 1 by 1, 100% of the time, with the press of a button.

2011-01-20T09:33:36Z	Minecraft - AEtherimp's Improved Variable Timer	This video demonstrates how to build an improved version of AEtherimp's redstone variable timer.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, the majority of the credit for this invention belongs to AEtherimp. The variable timer was his awesome idea and he figured out how to do it. Do NOT refer to this device as Etho's timer. It is AEtherimp's timer and his invention.\r\n\r\n I simply just figured out how to wire the lever controls independent of each other, and I came up with the idea of making the delays binary based.\r\n\r\nCheck out AEtherimp's tutorial for this binary variable timer here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_kAE63hoSk\r\nAEtherimp's original variable timer here: http://www.youtube.com/user/AEtherimp#p/u/5/fidSwsMEwn0\r\nAEtherimp's YouTube channel here: http://www.youtube.com/user/AEtherimp	YZE784N-nQc
2011-01-18T10:42:17Z	Minecraft - Tutorial: Rapid4 Dispenser	This video teaches you how to build a compact and very fast quad dispenser unit for dispensing building materials. \r\n\r\nI plan on adding a few of these in the large storage room I'm building in my LP world for dispensing some of the main block types (cobble, dirt, sand, etc.).\r\n\r\nI've timed the 4 dispensers releasing 16 blocks per second, or 960 blocks per minute. That is 4 blocks per second each, or 240 blocks per minute each. This is the same speed dispensers being activated by a rapid pulsar. \r\n\r\nActivating the Rapid4 Dispenser unit with a button causes it to run exactly 1 second, releasing exactly 16 blocks (4 each) every time.	3C54I84jpPQ
2011-01-16T10:02:54Z	Let's Play Minecraft - Episode 14: It Works!!... Kinda...	I removed all the torches from the mob spawning grounds in our big mob trap system.

2011-01-11T10:45:53Z	Let's Play Minecraft - Episode 11: Zombie Spawn Killer	We spend some time conquering a zombie spawner and building a very simple automatic harvester around it. The killing mechanism works by drowning the zombies. This makes it 100% efficient because it also kills the zombies as quickly as they spawn.\r\n\r\nThis spawn killer is quick and easy to build. Best of all, it is small and requires very few materials that are all easy to acquire.\r\n\r\nLater in the episode I also play around with the concept of converting my phone booth mob trap into a large wall.

2011-01-08T08:35:57Z	Minecraft - Underwater 360 Cannon	I demonstrate a new and unique design for an underwater 360 cannon. This cannon was built with stealth in mind. The cannon can be completely hidden under the ocean floor.\r\n\r\nThis cannon is unique because I believe it is the first true underwater cannon built in minecraft. By \"true underwater cannon\", I mean the first cannon where both the TNT missile(s) and TNT propellent  are actually placed in the ocean. Only the wiring and firing controls are placed inside a casing under the water.\r\n\r\nThe cannon is short to medium range and contains my modified version of EtherImp's variable timer system. If actually used in PVP, it would be considered a defensive cannon designed to destroy players crossing the ocean via boat.	dW2uzPrKHl8

SEOxrqvBtaY
2010-12-29T08:52:10Z	Minecraft - First 360 Cannon (Demonstration)	This is my new design for what I believe to be the first minecraft cannon capable of shooting a full 360 degrees around itself. It is able to accurately hit any target in sight if it is loaded correctly.\r\n\r\nIt features a slightly modified version of Etherimp's variable timer system, which allows this particular cannon to switch the payload's explosion delay to 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, or 26 quickly and easily by simply switching 3 levers on&off in different combinations. This allows it to remain an effective cannon when switching between short, medium, and far shots.\r\n\r\nThis particular cannon holds 1 ring of payload TNT (24) and 3 rings of booster TNT (3 * 8 = 24). The only real limit to the number of payload rings and booster rings you can have with this design is the sky limit.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional credit for this cannon belongs to:\r\n\r\nAEtherimp (NonProphet): for his awesome variable timer system. http://www.youtube.com/user/AEtherimp\r\n\r\nxFullMetal: for being an awesome assistant during the designing / testing of this cannon, and for helping me rebuild it countless time.\r\n\r\nA Neo Irony: for helping AEtherimp figure out the redstone wiring for the variable timer.	-S3QH6hRRgg

We visit my other world to look at a nearly finished intersection / junction for the EATS system. \r\n\r\nThis is a sneak peak to demonstrate how a finished road segment may function. The road junction demonstrates how to hook 4 road ends together in an effective manner.\r\n\r\nThis video also demonstrates how equal boat sharing is achieved in the system so that no dispenser will run out of boats or overload with boats.	fQZKFyHNRFg

2010-12-17T11:13:18Z	Let's Play Minecraft - Episode 1: It Begins!	I got a headset now and I decided I would try start a LP series because a lot of people have been asking me to. I'll still be posting new invention / tutorial videos separate from the LP videos.\r\n\r\nHopefully this LP will be a bit different than most minecraft LPs. I have a few guildlines I'll try to follow in my episodes:\r\n\r\n#1: I'm going to try teach you how to build cool, functioning things in mine craft.\r\n#2: I'm not going to explain all the basic introductory details about the game to you.\r\n#3: I am not going to focus on killing mobs, exploring, or building things that serve no purpose.\r\n#4: I'm not going to build things and then show them to you. This is a \"Let's\" Play, meaning I want you there with me when I build, plan, and discover things.\r\n\r\nI am aware that my commentary is a bit dry and flat, but I'm hoping that will improve as I do this more.	lHngf-CKCzk
2010-12-09T21:08:25Z	Minecraft - Flaming Mine Carts	Many people seem to like the flaming mine cart I have in my storage room. This video shows you how you can add the option to your mine cart stations to have flaming mine carts.\r\n\r\nPassing by the lava pillar makes the mine carts flaming. Passing by the water pillar will extinguish the flames. Adding the 5x3 track section to your mine cart system allows you to turn flaming mine carts on/off by controlling the junction.\r\n\r\nFlaming mine carts are mainly just for looks. They will burn indefinitely until they break or pass by a water column. The fire produces no light.\r\n\r\nMobs in flaming mine carts receive constant damage until they die. An application for this is creating new and interesting mob traps.\r\n\r\nMine carts will break if they pass by the lava too slowly. You can use this to quickly empty your storage carts.	Msdax4-mbJ4
2010-12-09T03:52:50Z	Minecraft - Mine Cart Gate	This is an improved version of my resource gate. It is more compact, works with mine carts, and items passing through it are not influenced by the water flow.\r\n\r\nI plan on using this for a complex mine cart storage system. An obvious application for this gate is to use it as a mine cart booster. It is stationary, meaning there is no issues with it stopping if chunks unload.	UpFwAr6Irv0
2010-12-08T18:25:02Z	Minecraft - (EATS) How To Build An Easy Loader	The boat roads are cool, but they are useless if you can't get on them properly. This video shows you how to build and connect an Easy Loader onto your roads.\r\n\r\nThey are a simple alternative to having a boat dispenser launching section. I'll post a video on how to build a proper boat launching road section once I finish getting all the kinks out of it.	0HFyHYhsFto
2010-12-08T08:56:06Z	Minecraft - (EATS) How To Build A Road	This shows how to build a 16x16 road section from scratch for my EATS system. It's fairly easy to build a flat road because you are just repeating a simple pattern over and over.\r\n\r\nThe glass dome is mainly just for looks, but it also keeps the critters out and holds the easy exits.\r\n\r\nOfficially, a road section is 16x16 even though the pattern is 8x4. Keeping your roads 16x16 makes it easier to connect different pieces together, such as intersections, in your roadways because all EATS parts will be 16x16.\r\n\r\nThe 16x16 section I build here requires:\r\n128 cobblestone, 136 glass, 32 half steps, 16 signs, 16 ladders,  8 torches, 4 boats	G5pXx97vEOY
2010-12-06T08:58:59Z	Minecraft - (EATS) New Prototype	This is my new (8x8) prototype for EATS. I wanted to show how a (8x8) boat dispenser with a return system could be attached to an end of the road. \r\n\r\nI also wanted to show how easy exits (the boats in the glass ceiling) can be placed in each road section, allowing a player to quickly get off the road at any time they want.\r\n\r\nSomething else cool, which I discovered by pure luck, is the rapid boat dispenser. It seems you can squeeze 2 boats in a 3 block space. When the launch door opens, the second boat behind you boosts you out, which accelerates you to maximum speed instantly instead of having a 3 second or so acceleration time.\r\n\r\nNote: The stone pressure plates are a cheap substitute for using signs to block the water flow. Build with signs to get rid of the tick tick noise.	x77lX-28iv4
2010-12-04T08:54:26Z	Minecraft - Boat Memory	This is a simple 1-bit memory, mechanical unit, that uses the position of the boat to store the on/off output. Pressing the button once, switches it on. Pressing it again, switches it off.\r\n\r\nI got this idea from #gneruinseruihnutshnu, who suggested I try build one using minecarts.\r\n\r\nI did not build this to try improve upon some redstone circuit. I actually have no idea what type of flip-flop this is. I was hoping a redstone expert could tell me, and also break down the Pros & Cons of how it compares.	Vn30WPO_CNQ
2010-12-03T08:58:08Z	Minecraft - Resource Gate	This device is used to control the flow of resource drops, such as those from an automatic cactus farm or a mob trap. \r\n\r\nConnecting a lever allows you to turn the flow on/off. Both connecting a lever and a button allows the drops to gather over time and then all fall at once when the lever is switched or the button is pressed.\r\n\r\nThe device is not useful to most people, but it may be useful in some complicated builds.	CnM5AWfw-_8
2010-12-02T06:23:06Z	Minecraft - (EATS) Proof Of Concept	EATS = Etho's Advanced Transportation System\r\n\r\nThis is just a simple proof of concept of a new highly structured boat transportation system I am designing. All complex transportation systems in minecraft so far have used mine carts. While still a little rough, I feel this boat transportation system may actually possess more potential than mine cart systems.\r\n\r\nSome key elements of this system include 2-way traffic that can handle many users at a time, controlled 4-way intersections, the ability to merge roads together in a grid pattern, maximum speed transport, and abandoned boat handling allowing a rider to get off at any point.\r\n\r\nBalance is kept in this system by opposites. Example: If 1 lane is flowing North, the other is flowing South. If 1 lane has a water elevator, the other lane should have a drop. If 1 lane has boat dispenser, the other lane should have a boat return, etc.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think and let me know how you feel it compares to mine cart systems. (both pros and cons)	4Vr7D4Pgois
2010-11-29T01:14:51Z	Minecraft - Compact Water Sensor	Please note: I did not come up with this invention. I saw it in a video by \"ribbitz\". All credit for the idea belongs to him. You can view his original video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqfJxRhQB2s\r\n\r\nThe reason I've posted this video is show people my compact version of it, how to build it from scratch, how you can wire it, and just how easy it is to build one. I love his idea and want to help people take advantage of it.\r\n\r\nWhat his device does is detect water and sends an inverted redstone signal indicating if there is water. I demonstrate how to use the device to implement a secret locking mechanism for your doors. There are many other applications you could use this for.	M9aBcRbZ2fk
2010-11-27T23:02:26Z	Minecraft - Random Cactus Logic	This is my new design for a simple device (5x5x7) that utilizes random logic from the game's code, for use in redstone wiring. The device has 8 outputs that can be wired in many different ways, according to the need of the player.\r\n\r\nIt's possible to make the outputs have even or uneven probabilities from each other. In this example I wire it to have 4 outputs, each with an equal 25% probability.\r\n\r\nThe device works like this: When the cactus grows, the new cactus growth block is in an invalid spot because there is a sign adjacent to it. This causes the cactus block to break and be thrown in a random direction, and a random velocity (with a set min & max), from the center of the cactus block. The cactus block then lands on one of the 8 outputs, and eventually disappears after a few (?) minutes.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that the growth time of the cactus is random. This means at certain times none of the outputs may be triggered or 2 of the outputs will be triggered. Also, I'm quite certain that the 4 corner outputs have a slightly lower probability of being pressed than the 4 side outputs.\r\n\r\nThis device can be modified in many different ways to suit your needs, including letting the cactus grow taller so that 2 blocks are dropped at once or having several cacti growing in the center.	rJUunBDkIjc
2010-11-27T00:21:16Z	Minecraft - Wood Generator (PATCHED)	This trick has been PATCHED. It no longer works.\r\n\r\nThis video demonstrates how to build a simple, on the spot wood generator. Breaking boats in this way makes them release 4x the normal amount of wood and sticks (12 wood and 8 sticks each boat). It costs 5 wood to craft a boat, so you earn 7 wood and 8 sticks profit.\r\n\r\nYou can use lava instead of cactus if you wish. I use cactus in this design because I think it is safer for the player. Fire does not work.	QWvkkee-Qnk
2010-11-26T04:42:50Z	Minecraft - Wood Dispenser	I just wanted to show off my silly invention... oh how I wish the wood supply was infinite. Basically it's just my boat shredder hooked to a new inverted style, quick release, vertical boat dispenser. (The boats stack in a water elevator instead of in the air - boats go up instead of down.)\r\n\r\nThe boat shredder takes advantage of a trick to give back double the wood normally produced by breaking a boat. That's 6 wood and 4 sticks instead of the normal 3 wood and 2 sticks. However, about 15% of the wood and sticks produced are destroyed by the lava.\r\n\r\nIn this demonstration I burn a huge stack of 100 boats over a duration of about 2 minutes. I get 531 wood and 352 sticks from this. It costs 500 wood to build 100 boats, so that's a 31 wood and 352 stick profit (0.31 wood and 3.52 sticks per boat). That is equivalent to 51.75 logs, or harvesting about 10 trees.\r\n\r\nTree farms are still the best way to get wood. I just wish Notch would fix the leaves not dying issue.	qwfHuvVM2-o
2010-11-25T02:59:51Z	Minecraft - Compact Boat Junction	I've come up with a new, different, more compact design for my boat junction. Like before, the route taken by the boat is controlled by the door, which can be wired to redstone circuits.\r\n\r\nThe 90 degree turn is important for aligning the boat so that it will travel straight and be able to flow pass the junction door if it is open. The stream the boat lands in, just after it hits the wall in the turn, must be 8 water blocks long and end 1 block before the junction door. \r\n\r\nThe junction door must be 1 block lower than this stream so that the boat can touch the water in Route #1 if the door is open.\r\n\r\nGlass blocks with signs attached are used to control the water flow patterns while still allowing a player to pass through them unharmed.\r\n\r\nMy original gravity based boat junction can be mixed with this junction design to create a more advanced 3-way junction.	6n7iy5laJqQ
2010-11-24T09:20:12Z	Minecraft - The Ticker	This video shows how to build a small, easy to build, timing device in minecraft. It's a possible alternative to red stone clocks.\r\n\r\nI like it because it has 2 outputs with alternating lights that seem to switch at the exact same time. You can also extend the tracks longer if you want a longer clock cycle.\r\n\r\nI also demonstrate how to do compact vertical up and down redstone wiring. I figured this out on my own, I'm sure others have too, but the majority of minecraft players don't seem to know about it.	bSu7Sk16Bj0

2010-11-12T19:25:32Z	Minecraft Boat Dispenser	I wanted to build a multiple boat dispenser in my minecraft world because I kept having issues with my boats floating away into the ocean and cluttering up the place. After searching around a long time for tutorials on how to build one; I couldn't find any... so I designed my own system.\r\n\r\nThis video demonstrates how it works and shows the design (so that people can copy it and maybe even improve it). The goal was simplicity. Basically, if I want a boat, all I need to do is push a button. It took a lot of tweaking to get it working properly because I had constant problems with the boats getting stuck. It seems to work now 100% without any boat jams.\r\n\r\nMy system holds 6 boats, but this number can easily be increased by repeating the boat hold pattern (6x8x3 space). Just make sure your dispenser button and boat holds are within 300 blocks of each other.	PsX7J8bs0CA
